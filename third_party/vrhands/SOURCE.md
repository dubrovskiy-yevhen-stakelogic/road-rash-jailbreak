# UltimateXR hand assets

The hand geometry and source mask textures used to build these runtime assets
come from [VRMADA/ultimatexr-unity](https://github.com/VRMADA/ultimatexr-unity),
commit `985f20c`.

Used source assets:

- `Runtime/Art/Avatars/BigHands/BigHandLeftGeo.fbx`
- `Runtime/Art/Avatars/BigHands/BigHandRightGeo.fbx`
- `Runtime/Art/Avatars/BigHands/HandPoses/Default.asset`
- `Runtime/Art/Avatars/BigHands/HandPoses/Grab.asset`
- `Runtime/Art/Avatars/BigHands/Textures/BigHandsTex_Mask1.png`
- `Runtime/Art/Avatars/BigHands/Textures/BigHandsTex_Mask2.png`
- `Runtime/Art/Avatars/BigHands/Textures/BigHandsTex_Mask3.png`

The FBX meshes are converted offline to the `UXRH` runtime format. The open,
grip, trigger and combined poses are baked from UltimateXR's authored finger
poses. `BigHandsAlbedo.png` is an offline Type 3 skin-colour approximation made
from the original masks; it does not include Unity or Shader Graph code.
