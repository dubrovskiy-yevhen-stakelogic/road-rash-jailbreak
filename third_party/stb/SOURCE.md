The hashes above identify the originally retrieved upstream headers.

Local patch: `stb_image_write.h` formats the HDR header with
`snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), ...)` instead of `sprintf`, which is deprecated
by current Apple SDKs. It rejects formatting errors/truncation before passing
the length to the write callback. Existing successful output is unchanged;
project-wide warning checks remain enabled.
